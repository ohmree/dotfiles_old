LivePage is a developer tool which reloads website resources (such as CSS, HTML and JavaScript) as they update on the server, so you are always looking at the most up-to-date version of a web page. It can make developing websites a lot faster, by helping productivity.

Features:
  * Entire domains can be made live
  * file:// protocol is now supported

It's recommended you use this extension only in a local development environment and not in a production environment.
